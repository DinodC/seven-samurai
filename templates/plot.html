<p>In 16th century Japan, farmers in a small village face the prospect of again
losing their crops to a band of roving thieves. Their solution is to go to the
nearest city and see if they can hire samurai to protect them.</p>

<p>The farmers are poor and can only offer food and lodging but they soon recruit
Kambei Shimada who determines that they will need a total of seven samurai to
properly guard the village.</p>

<p>Slowly, he recruits other samurai for their task and once complete, move to the
village. There they teach the farmers basic self defense and fortify the village
itself.</p>

<p>When the bandits attack, they are prepared but suffer many losses.</p>
